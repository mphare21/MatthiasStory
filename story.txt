	A day in class starts with sitting down and taking out a laptop for taking notes. Next, listening to a proffesor go over valuable information. While this is going on, I am taking notes. These notes help when i faced the difficult p2 assignment, a fearsome enemy.

Binary Search Trees were a review, until we were challenged with a intimidating method (remove).
This method had to be created with careful consideration of border cases. Then I tried to submit my BST to Gradescope and multiple exceptions were found...

Then I found I also have problem with AVL implementation. I tried several times,but my AVL implmentation just could not rotate in the right way, so I asked a TAin the next day and figured it out. 

The TA helped me understand the AVL implementation and I was able to get almost 50% on the assignment, probably. What a time to be alive. Can't wait to do it again next week!
